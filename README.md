Domain for Sale


## Why am I selling it?

After my own health giving my an accelerated education in the Microbiome I was passionate to start a business with this theme with another partner (interestingly the idea we had turned out to be similar to TakeThesis). 
Ultimately the partner and I decided to work on different things, however I could not let this potentially iconic domain and brand name simply disappear into the ether for GoDaddy bots to snatch up.

## Why is it valuable?

- Short and memorable, just 5 letters. 
- Very phonetic, almost impossible to spell incorrectly after hearing it.
- Flexible Brand name associating:
1. Bio, as in biology or biome.
2. Biota, as in gut flora and fauna. 
3. Tame, as in mastered, trained, or subjugated.
4. Me, as in personalised, or personalised medicine. 

## Asking Price

Between 5000 USD and 9000 USD -- depending on the level of interest.

## Contact 

If interested, get in touch via Calendly.
Deadline is 21th July.

(For any referrals or direct transactions that don't need to involve a broker, I’m happy to share the commission they would have got i.e. 500 USD, or if you would prefer, we can donate that to UNICEF)
