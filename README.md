# biota.me
Domain for Sale


## Why is it valuable?

- Short and memorable, just 5 letters. 
- Very phonetic, almost impossible to spell incorrectly after hearing it.
- Flexible Brand name associating:
1. Bio, as in biology or biome
2. Biota, as in gut flora and fauna or flora in general. 
3. Tame, as in mastered, trained, or subjugated.
4. Me, as in personalised, bespoke, tailored. 

## Why am I selling it?

After my own health giving my an accelerated education in the Microbiome I was passionate to start a business with this theme with another partner (interestingly the idea we had turned out to be similar to TakeThesis). 
Ultimately the partner and I decided to work on different things, however I could not let this iconic domain name and potential brand name simply disappear into the ether for GoDaddy bots to snatch up.
